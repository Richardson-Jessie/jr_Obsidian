For Gap Reporting we need top show to explain to the users why a call is not compliant, this is especially different as the way we report on work orders has changed. 

The Denominator is any open work order that has a PMAct Type for Statutory Works, this is different as we are no longer looking at if the work order is scheduled in the reporting week. This way consumers can see the whole picture not just what is Scheduled within the reporting week.
### Reasons for Non Compliance
	1. Work Order Cancelled
	2. Work Order Not Released Prior to Reporting Week Start
	3. Work Order Is Not Executed
	5. The Variance for the Planned & Basic Finish / Completion Date is greater than 14 days At Backward Snaphot
	6. The Variance for Planned & Basic Finish is greater than 14 days at Forward Snapshot


# FIX

- [ ] Not Compliant Work Order Planned Date Is More Then 14 Behind Reporting Week Finish Date|
