Hi Jessie,

Just following up on the Teams chat we had. Regarding the Prestart Current Notification section can that be configured to look at the Technical object as that is the basis of all notification and not the question. Also see attached email the supervisor frustration that we have prior to the last update, and I remember Ervin said that the would like be a couple of future updated to come, however I haven’t heard of anything yet.

Hi Gary,

Thanks for time this morning looking through some of the issue with SOL325 windscreen defects repeat notifications and sending me the SQ00 Report for Question & List Results to view. Below is what we discussed and some question for possible improvements.



# Point 1
What we initially found was the Supervisor were rejecting & completing repeat notification which created this issue that a new notification must be raised next time a fail is ticked.


# Point 2
The prestart does show that on the last inspection it was failed but again you need to raise another notification if the last one was rejected NOCO ( Is it possible to have a question if failed again is this the same defect and continue that way without raising a new one?)

# Point 3

If failed previously and then passed is it possible to put a question here as a stop. Q. An Open Notification exists for this defect are you sure you want to pass? Is the defect still present?

# Point 4

At the top of the Prestart it has current notifications and it says 0 but we know that there is an open notification for this defect with and order assigned why is this not showing as a current noti


# Point 5
It is also possible that regardless if the previous inspection is Passed Failed Passed and the Notifications are reject noco that as long as there is an open notification for that defect that a duplicated notification can’t be raised this could possibly avoid the need for the above questions

# Point 6

Most Prestart defects are currently raise as an M1 under the S4 Hana principles all defect regardless of how minor should be raised as an M2 can we change the configuration so it is aligned correctly. - DONE

The only advantage of leaving the Notification as an M1 it forces the supervisor to approve the notification. But they should then change it to and M2 but that is not happening.
